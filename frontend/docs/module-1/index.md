# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand ROS 2 architecture and communication patterns
- Create ROS 2 nodes in Python
- Implement publishers, subscribers, services, and actions
- Model robots using URDF
- Control a simulated humanoid robot

## What is ROS 2?

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) is the middleware that powers modern robots. Think of it as the **nervous system** of a robot - it connects sensors to processing units to actuators.

## Module Structure

1. **ROS 2 Architecture** - Nodes, topics, and communication
2. **Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions** - Communication patterns
3. **Python Control** - Programming robots with rclpy
4. **URDF Modeling** - Describing robot geometry and kinematics

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming
- Understanding of Linux command line
- Familiarity with object-oriented programming

## Lab Setup

All exercises use simulation first - no physical robot required!
