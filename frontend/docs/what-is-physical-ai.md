# What is Physical AI?

**Physical AI** refers to artificial intelligence systems that perceive, reason about, and act upon the physical world through embodied agents like robots.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Embodiment
Intelligence requires a body. Physical AI systems have:
- **Sensors** to perceive the world (cameras, microphones, touch)
- **Actuators** to act on the world (motors, grippers, speakers)
- **Computing** to process and decide

### 2. Perception → Reasoning → Action Loop

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  Perception │ ──→ │  Reasoning  │ ──→ │   Action    │
│  (Sensors)  │     │   (Brain)   │     │ (Actuators) │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
       ↑                                       │
       └───────────────────────────────────────┘
              Feedback from Environment
```

### 3. Human-Robot Interaction
Physical AI systems must understand and respond to humans naturally through:
- Speech recognition and generation
- Gesture understanding
- Social awareness

## Why Physical AI Matters

Traditional AI excels at digital tasks but struggles with:
- Understanding physical causality
- Manipulating real-world objects
- Adapting to unpredictable environments

Physical AI addresses these gaps by grounding intelligence in embodied experience.

## Examples of Physical AI

- **Humanoid Robots** (Boston Dynamics Atlas, Tesla Optimus)
- **Autonomous Vehicles** (self-driving cars)
- **Robotic Manipulators** (warehouse robots, surgical robots)
- **Social Robots** (companion robots, educational robots)
