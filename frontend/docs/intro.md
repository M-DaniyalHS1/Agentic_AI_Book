# Introduction to Physical AI

Welcome to the **AI-Native Digital Textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**.

## What You'll Learn

This textbook bridges the gap between software intelligence and physical embodiment. You'll learn:

- How to build robots that think and act intelligently
- ROS 2 architecture for robotic control
- Simulation environments (Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac Sim)
- Vision-Language-Action pipelines
- How to create reproducible robotics experiments

## Why Physical AI?

Modern AI education often treats software and robotics as separate disciplines. This textbook unifies them, teaching you how perception, reasoning, action, and human interaction work together in Physical AI systems.

## How to Use This Book

Each module includes:
- 📚 **Learning Objectives** - What you'll master
- 📖 **Conceptual Explanations** - Clear theory
- 🎨 **Visual Aids** - Diagrams and flows
- 🧪 **Hands-On Labs** - Runnable code
- 🤖 **Simulations** - Virtual robot experiments
- ✅ **Assessments** - Test your knowledge

## AI Tutor Integration

Throughout this book, you can:
- Ask questions about any concept
- Get explanations of selected text
- Receive step-by-step guidance
- See citations to exact sections

Let's begin your journey into Physical AI!
