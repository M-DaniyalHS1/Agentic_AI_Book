# Module 2: The Digital Twin

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand digital twin concepts for robotics
- Set up Gazebo simulation environments
- Create Unity-based robot simulations
- Implement physics, gravity, and collision detection
- Simulate sensors (cameras, LiDAR, IMU)

## What is a Digital Twin?

A **digital twin** is a virtual replica of a physical robot that allows you to:
- Test algorithms safely
- Validate designs before building
- Collect synthetic training data
- Debug complex behaviors

## Module Structure

1. **Gazebo Simulation** - Classic robotics simulator
2. **Unity Simulation** - High-fidelity graphics
3. **Physics & Gravity** - Realistic dynamics
4. **Sensor Simulation** - Virtual cameras and LiDAR

## Prerequisites

- Module 1: ROS 2 basics
- Basic understanding of 3D coordinate systems
- Python programming skills
